    [Documentation]    1	From the console port display the network management interface 	verify that the default config un-provisioned. there should be no ip, vlan or .p
    ...    2	Enter config mode for the interface and configure the VLAN, the .p, mode DHCP and enable it. Show the interface	the config should take and the port should show the configure vlan and .p. The mode should be set to DHCP.
    ...    3	Configure a DHCP server that hands back an ip address, netmask and default GW
    ...    4	configure the DUT to have access to a DHCP server on the configure network interface VLAN. this could be an untagged port to the network or via an ERPS ring.
    ...    5	show the network interface 	the interface should have successfully DHCP'ed an address with an IP, netmask and GW
    ...    6	From the DUT verify ping another device on the same network	this should be sucessfully
    ...    7	From the DUT verify ping another device on a different network 	the ping should be successful
